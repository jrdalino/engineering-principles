## Security, Privacy, Compliance
- 1 Compliance, Data Privacy is King
- 2 Security Hardening at all layers; All trafic Encrypted in transit and all data encrypted at rest
- 3 CIA + AAA: AuthN, AuthZ (Least Privilege), Audit in place

## Reliability
- 4 Agreement + Contract with the Business
- 5 Observability. Ensure Monitoring (Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation), Logging and Alering in place
- 6 AutoScaling of all layers in place

## Performance Efficiency & Cost Optimisation
- 7 Costing: Actuals vs Benchmarks vs Forecast
- 8 Benchark Price/Performance Ratio
- 9 Performance Tuning/Optimisation at all layers

## Operational Excellence
- 10 Everything as Code (Infra, Application, Configuration, Policy, Pipelines, Decisions)
- 11 Automation of Builds, Test, Deployments and Rollbacks
- 12 Everything fails. We plan for Disasters & Business Continuity
